# MultiPy
Testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously increases the number of false 
positive findings if the p-values are not corrected. While this multiple 
testing problem is well known, the classic and advanced correction methods 
are yet to be implemented into a coherent Python package. This package 
sets out to fill this gap by implementing methods for controlling the 
family-wise error rate (FWER) and the false discovery rate (FDR).
